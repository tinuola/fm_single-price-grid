### Retrospective

- Very first Frontend Mentor project! üëèüèæ ‚≠ê
- Straight-forward, simple starter to resume my frontend practice
- Could not avoid contrast error flags in A11Y audit (WAVE)--the color choices came from the design
- Refactored a second time around for a mobile-first approach, to clean up redundant CSS, and to rename the box components semantically

### Enhancement(s)

- None planned

### Tools & Resources

- HTML & CSS
- CSS Resets
